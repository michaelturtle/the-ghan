<h2>The Journey</h2>
<p>There's a lot to see and do along the 3000 kilometre journey from Darwin to Adelaide on The Ghan.</p>
<p>Most of the days are taken up with excursions into the outback to see some of the best sites on offer in central Australia.</p>
<p>But there are activities on board and life on the train is just as exciting as the stops along the way.</p>
<p>In this story, I'll give you an overview of what it's like to take a journey on The Ghan.</p>

  <p> My room lurches slightly and the landscape starts to move. The faint sounds of the track beneath me seep up from the floor. I’m excited about the adventure ahead.
  <p> I am on board The Ghan, one of the most iconic trains in the world. It travels between two Australian cities, Darwin and Adelaide, along a 3000 kilometre stretch of track, connecting the top of the country to the bottom. In between is some of the harshest landscapes on the planet, filled with natural beauty and fascinating culture.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-8.jpg" />
  <p> The route roughly follows the trails used in the early pioneering days of the country more than 150 years ago. These explorers took camels with them as they set out into the centre of Australia because the animals were more suitable for the extreme conditions. These camels were said to be driven by men from Afghanistan (although they could have been from Pakistan), hence the name of the train.</p>
  <p> These days things are a bit more luxurious but that doesn’t mean the sense of exploration is gone.</p>
  <p> The trip I’m taking is called ‘The Ghan Expedition’, which is a three night and four day journey (as opposed to the normal trip which is two nights and three days). The extra day has been added to give passengers more time to do excursions off the train and see as much of Central Australia as possible.</p>
  <p>The first stop is Katherine, where I get off and go on a tour of Nitmiluk Gorge. This natural wonder is managed by the local indigenous people, who take visitors along the waterways and explain the nature and the culture.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-6.jpg" />
  <p> There are several restaurant carriages spread along the 750 metre length of the train. I head to mine a little early on the first evening so I can have a drink in the lounge before the dining time I’ve requested.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-7.jpg" />
  <p> Dinner on The Ghan is a three course affair with several choices for each. I notice there’s an emphasis on Australian food but it’s only when I later speak to the chef that he tells me the ingredients also reflect the local area we’re passing through. The style is fine dining with some outback flair and the meals are impressive.</p>
  <p> In the morning, when I wake up, we’re almost in Alice Springs.</p>
  <p> My room in the Gold Class (which makes up the majority of the train) has a small cupboard for storage and its own bathroom with shower. During the day, there’s a long comfortable lounge to sit on. At night it turns into a bed and another one folds down from the wall, bunk style. The staff make the beds while you’re at dinner and then put them away while you’re at breakfast.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-1.jpg" />
  <p> For this journey on The Ghan Expedition, almost all of the excursions are included in the price. There are just a few special ones you can do that are an additional cost. One of those extra ones today is a scenic flight to Uluru and a tour on the ground around the rock. Seeing the rock close up gives you angles and perspectives you couldn’t imagine exist.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-5.jpg" />
  <p> Tonight there’s a special dinner planned off the train at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station. Tables are set up in the open air. As the sun sets, some people take a ride on camels, or stand around the fires. A band starts up and night falls. Under the Milky Way, we all feast on a gourmet barbeque. Before the night ends, there’s a talk about the stars, pointing out the features you can see from here in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-4.jpg" />
  <p> Once again, the train travels overnight while the passengers are asleep. Before going to bed, I stop at the lounge for a glass of wine. There’s a great selection of Australian wines available and I’m attempting to try as many as possible over the course of the journey. All the food and drinks, including the alcohol in the lounge, is included in the price of the trip. It’s nice to be able to have what you want, when you want, and not touch your wallet for the entire four days.</p>
  <p> The next morning we’re almost at Coober Pedy. As I wait for our arrival, I watch the desert roll by outside the window and eat my cooked breakfast.</p>
  <p> Coober Pedy is a South Australian mining town that boomed after 1915 when the first opals were found here. This mining history is part of the town’s story but the most interesting aspect is the style of living here. Many of the residents live underground, digging their homes into hills or beneath the surface. They do it this way to maintain a constant temperature inside, in a place where outside it can get above 40 degrees in summer and to freezing at night in winter.</p>
  <img src="/images/ghan-journey-3.jpg" />
  <p> When we get back from the excursion, there’s a bonfire going and the staff are serving drinks and snacks. People gather in groups around the tables and chat. New friendships have clearly been made already. Although people tend to come on The Ghan alone, as couples, or with family members, it’s hard to avoid interacting with other guests.</p>
    <img src="/images/ghan-journey-2.jpg" />
  <p> The dining carriage, for instance, has tables of four and you’ll usually be seated with someone else. The layout of the lounge lets you talk amongst yourself or turn slightly and start a conversation with the people nearby. And there are plenty of opportunities to mingle on the excursions.</p>
  <p> Perhaps it’s the price point that makes it more attractive for older people, or perhaps it’s the convenience of the style of travel. I also tend to think it’s about the image - luxury train travel is the kind of thing only retired people do, isn’t it? Well, I’m not so sure. I reckon the trip would be incredible if the lounge was full of thirty and forty year-olds, enjoying the wine after a day in the outback.</p>
  <p> But what’s most surprising for me is how little time there actually is to just sit around and chat. The evenings are leisurely but the days are busy, filled with excursions and meals. This isn’t the long days of staring out a window and reading a book I had anticipated. It’s more like a cruise where the nights are for travel and the days for activities.</p>
    <img src="/images/ghan-journey-9.jpg" />
  <p> When we arrive in Adelaide and everyone starts to leave the train, it’s warming to see passengers farewelling each other and saying goodbye to the staff. A bit of a bond has formed over four days on the track. I know the names of all the people who have been working in my section and I wish each of them the best.</p>
  <p> Back in a big city, I notice almost immediately that my jumper smells like bonfire and red dirt is still on my shoes. Little traces of a (luxurious) adventure. The Ghan, following the trail of early explorers, still offers discoveries and new horizons for travellers today.</p>
