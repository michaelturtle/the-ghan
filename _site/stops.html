  <h2>Nitmiluk Gorge</h2>
  <h4>Northern Territory</h4>
  <p>Nitmiluk Gorge was formerly known as Katherine Gorge until it was renamed with a more appropriate indigenous title. (‘Nitmiluk’ means “place of the cicada dreaming”.) The gorge is close to the town of Katherine and it borders Kakadu National Park to the north. </p>
  <p>It’s one of the natural highlights in this part of Australia’s Northern Territory, a region where there is no shortage of unique experiences in the vastness of nature. The name ‘Nitmiluk Gorge’ is slightly misleading because there is actually not one but a series of gorges that run through the national park. There are thirteen of them with rapids and waterfalls in between. They were cut out of the sandstone by the river that runs through the middle.</p>
  <img src="/images/nitmiluk-1.jpg" />
  <p>When I visit, it’s dry season in the Northern Territory. That means the water levels are low and calm - perfect for a boat trip along a couple of stretches of the gorge. (It also means that there are only freshwater crocodiles in the water - harmless to humans. The saltwater crocodiles, who would pull a human underwater, can only come up the river during the wet season.)</p>
  <p>Tyrus is our tour guide for the afternoon. As we ride along above the water, he talks about the age of the geology here (1.6 billion years old), talks about the history of the indigenous Jawoyn people, and cracks quite a few jokes for good measure.</p>
  <p>In between the two sections, we get out and walk over the rocks. There’s no ‘tour’ here. Everyone just walks at their own pace and enjoys the atmosphere in their own way.</p>
    <img src="/images/nitmiluk-2.jpg" />
  <p>The Jawoyn people had to fight to get control of this land under the native title laws that Australia brought in during the 20th century. From start to finish, the process took more than ten years. The simple version of the story is that it only happened because more than 50 indigenous clans came together and brought representatives from the Federal Government to the area to show them how their ancestors used the land for thousands and thousands of years.</p>
    <img src="/images/nitmiluk-3.jpg" />
  <p>Going between gorges, Tyrus and I are walking along a path that’s been created amongst the boulders, the escarpment towering above us to the right, water running between rocks down to the left. I ask him what this area would have been used for before the Europeans arrived. He tells me it would have been a fishing spot and explains why.</p>
  <p>“You’ve got two creeks and then you’ve got two main rivers on either side,” he says. “In the wet season, there are plenty of fish coming through and getting stuck in these rock holes.”</p>
    <img src="/images/nitmiluk-4.jpg" />
  <p>It feels so serene here. Even with the tourists walking through at the moment, it’s quiet. There’s the sound of the wind when it picks up and animals if you listen closely. But mainly it sounds like calmness.</p>
  <p>Tyrus explains that the Jawoyn people would have viewed it the same way.</p>
  <p>“It was pretty much a spot where they could relax,” he says. “Where they could not be in too much of a rush, not walk around trying to get themselves killed by chasing something else to kill.”</p>
    <img src="/images/nitmiluk-5.jpg" />
  <p>The natural setting is beautiful and I really am blown away by the colours and the scale of everything here. But, unexpectedly, it’s Tyrus who is the highlight of the excursion. He provides a connection to the stories of the Jawoyn people and does it in a way that seems so friendly and relatable.</p>
  <p>People and nature. When they go inherently go together, you need someone who can guide you through both.</p>

<section id="uluru">
  <h2>Uluru</h2>
  <h4>Northern Territory</h4>
  <p>For one of the most photographed natural sites in Australia, there is a lot that’s unexpected.</p>
  Flying in on a small place from Alice Springs, I spot Uluru before we land and it’s the image you have come to recognise.</p>
  <p>We land at the airport and drive straight to the most popular viewpoint. Here there are still no surprises. This is the postcard view, the rock in full sunlight, red and vibrant, relatively barren land before it.</p>
  <img src="/images/uluru-1.jpg" />
  <p>But, leaving the viewpoint and driving closer, Uluru takes on a different shape. In fact, it takes on many different shapes. From a distance, it appears as a smooth monolith, like a pebble shaped by waters. In actual fact, it has ridges and crests, small canyons, caves and irregular slopes. Patterns on the face tell the story of time - and the people who have lived here for thousands of years have told their own stories through these shapes.</p>
  <img src="/images/uluru-2.jpg" />
  <p>My guide for the day, Nadia Wallace, takes us to the Mutitjulu Waterhole, an unexpected oasis on one side of Uluru where gum trees grow and birds hop between the branches. This cool and green environment isn’t what I expected out here.</p>
  <p>Nadia points out the markings high up on the side of the rock, caused by erosion and other natural damage. She tells the tale that the markings inspired for the local Anangu people, which they shared with each other when they were alone on this land for countless generations. It’s a tale about honour and respect and punishment for those who don’t follow that code.</p>
  <img src="/images/uluru-3.jpg" />
  <p>The Anangu people have lived here for about 20,000 years and their first contact with non-indigenous foreigners wasn’t until the 1870s. These stories were their version of biblical tales - parables with which to learn to act as a community. They saw Uluru as a spiritual place and even today you can feel it. The rock and the surroundings seem to give off an energy that could be from a force of divinity.</p>
  <p>A few hours on the ground is long enough to feel the energy of Uluru but not long enough to become absorbed by it. Many parts of the site - including the entire northeastern face - are designated as sacred areas because of their significance to the indigenous inhabitants. That means people aren’t allowed to take photos of these areas and so it’s likely you’ve never seen images of them before. These, in particular, are the places that I would like to have spent more time looking at, thinking about, being a part of.</p>
  <img src="/images/uluru-4.jpg" />
  <p>Ever since climbing the rock has been discouraged, the guardians of Uluru have worked to provide more appropriate experiential options for visitors. One of them is a hike that goes the entire way around the base. That’s something I would love to come back and do sometime. The diversity within the single walk - the sun and shade, the caves, the different colours of the rocks, the trees, the paintings, the wildlife - create a picture words could never do justice. It’s about the soul as much as anything.</p>
  <img src="/images/uluru-5.jpg" />
  <p>Spirituality is, in many ways, a human construct. It is something we have created for tens of thousands of years to explain the unexplainable elements in our life that feel as true as anything we can touch. It’s easy, from a distance, to say that indigenous people just created the spirituality of Uluru as a part of their belief system. But, close up, it doesn’t feel that way. It’s real, it’s here, and no postcard photo will share it with you.</p>
  <p>Uluru needs to be felt to be truly seen.</p>

<section id ="coober-pedy">
  <h2>Coober Pedy</h2>
  <h4>South Australia</h4>
  <p>In the middle of the Australian desert, search hard enough and you’ll find a gem. Thousands of people over the years have come looking for it. For many it has brought success, for others it has been their downfall. Such is the way when the stakes are so high.</p>
  <p>This gem? It’s called Coober Pedy.</p>
  <img src="/images/coober-pedy-5.jpg" />
  <p>On the surface, the existence of the town of Coober Pedy seems odd. It’s in the nowhere of South Australia, about 850 kilometres north of Adelaide. In summer, the heat is scorching. In winter, it is freezing. Head in any direction and it’s hours through the red earth until you reach anything you might call ‘civilisation’.</p>
  <p>But Coober Pedy is not about what is on the surface. It’s about what’s underground and there are two very important things there - opals and homes.</p>
  <p>Opals were first found in the ground around Coober Pedy in 1915 and since then the small town has been supplying most of the world’s high quality opals. Buyers from around the world fly in to the tiny airstrip for the day to make deals with briefcases of cash. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are can be exchanged in just hours.</p>
  <img src="/images/coober-pedy-1.jpg" />
  <p>But it all has to come from somewhere and Coober Pedy is interesting in the sense that it hasn’t been taken over by a handful of large mining companies. This is still a place where anyone can make it rich with some basic knowledge and a bit of luck.</p>
  <p>Each mining plot that is leased to prospectors is a square, 15 metres by 15 metres. It’s always been cheap enough to lease a plot that someone with nothing can arrive in town and start digging. The problem is that most of the plots have no valuables in them. It’s all about finding the right spot.</p>
  <p>The temperature in Coober Pedy reaches well above 40 degrees Celsius in summer and below zero degrees in winter. Back in the days when the town was founded, air conditioners and heaters weren’t realistic options for residents - the power or fuel to run them was unavailable or too expensive. So the first mining residents came up with an innovative idea… to build the houses underground.</p>
  <img src="/images/coober-pedy-4.jpg" />
  <p>It’s one of the things you hear about Coober Pedy before you go there - “the houses are underground”. I had known that for years and years, even though I had never visited before. In my mind’s eye, I had this image of a hole on the surface with a ladder that took you down into a home with tunnels between rooms. It’s not like that.</p>
  <p>Actually, most of the ‘underground’ houses look exactly like normal houses except there are no windows. Most of them have been cut into the side of hills or have sloping driveways down to the entrances, so there’s no holes or ladders. The front of the houses are often in the open air, with a terrace. It’s when you go beyond the front doors that you have rock all around you.</p>
  <p>We visit the underground Serbian Orthodox Church which is beautifully decorated inside rock. A local miner explains what life is like in the town (tough, as you might imagine), and then there’s special lunch inside an old mine. In a cavern where opals had once been dug out, the meal is served without windows.</p>
  <img src="/images/coober-pedy-2.jpg" />
  <p>In a country where 85 per cent of people live within 50 kilometres of the coast, it’s sometimes easy to forget (or not know) what life is like in these small remote towns. It was the chance of riches that brought most people to Coober Pedy and fortunes have been found and lost. With advances in technology, it’s easier living here than ever before but nothing can change the geography and it still feels isolated.</p>
  <img src="/images/coober-pedy-3.jpg" />
  <p>As tourism increases (and it’s now a big industry here) more visitors are getting an insight into the town. Many people come for the gems found in the earth but Coober Pedy is a gem in itself. To see its full colours, you need to search underground as well.</p>

  <h2>The Breakaways</h2>
  <h4>South Australia</h4>
  <p>“Just drive to the Dog Fence, take a left, and continue on until the ground isn’t flat.” These are the kinds of instructions that work in central Australia.</p>
  <p>The Dog Fence itself is fascinating - a real marvel of scale that is only possible in a few places on the planet. It stretches for 5,600 kilometres across more than half of Australia. Made mainly of high wire mesh, it was first built in the 1880s and is still constantly maintained. The aim is to keep dingoes out of the part of the country where most of the farmland is located.</p>
  <img src="/images/breakaways-1.jpg" />
  <p>But the fence is not the focus for today. (Maybe I’ll go back one day and see a bit more of it so I can write a more detailed story.) Today it is just a nice bonus on a trip out to one of the most interesting natural sites around the South Australian town of Coober Pedy. I’m on my way to The Breakaways (now known as Kanku-Breakaways).</p>
  <img src="/images/breakaways-2.jpg" />
  <p>I’ve already written about my time in Coober Pedy, a tough remote town in the middle of Australia. Most people who come out here are more interested in what’s beneath the ground, not what’s on top of it. That’s because value these days is often judged by monetary value, not natural beauty.</p>
  <p>Opals, the reason for the existence of Coober Pedy, may have both… but that doesn’t take anything away from Kanku-Breakaways. And in one day, there is enough time to see the town with its opal mines, desert golf course, underground homes, and harsh environs… and still make it out to this special protected area.</p>
  <img src="/images/breakaways-3.jpg" />
  <p>The Breakaways was the name given to this place by the European settlers. It was meant to capture the visual impression you get when you arrive - the large colourful mounds that rise up, creating cliffs, mountains, valleys and plains. It looks as though this whole area is trying to break away from the desert and break into song and dance in celebration of its vibrancy.</p>
  <img src="/images/breakaways-4.jpg" />
  <p>At the end of 2015, the name was officially changed to Kanku-Breakaways to recognise the indigenous owners of the land. ‘Kanku’ means ‘shelter’ in the traditional language and this is a place that has provided shelter from the scorching conditions to animals, plants and people for thousands of years.</p>
  <p>For me, there’s no need for shelter. The temperature is pleasant enough and I’m excited to run around, taking photos of as much as I can. The sweeping views from the lookouts are amazing, but so are the little details like the plants and the glittering pieces of gypsum in the soil.</p>
  <p>My visit to Kanku-Breakaways is relatively short. It’s part of a day trip to Coober Pedy that is one of the stops on my journey on The Ghan Expedition from Darwin to Adelaide.</p>
  <img src="/images/breakaways-5.jpg" />
  <p>Because time was limited, we did everything by driving and only stopped at a few spots. If you’ve got time, you might want to consider going for a hike through some of the walk. There are marked trails that you need to stick to but you won’t regret getting a range of viewpoints.</p>
