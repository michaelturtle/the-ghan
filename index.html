      <h2> The Journey </h2>
      <p>The Ghan is a journey of 3000 kilometres, amongst some of the harshest terrain on the planet, from the north to the south of Australia.</p>
      <p>This was the vast desert inland that tested colonial explorers for decades.</p>
      <p>Today the landscapes haven’t changed but the expeditions have. We’ll be travelling on board a luxury train. </p>
